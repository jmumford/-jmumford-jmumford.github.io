# About me

I have a PhD in Biostatistics with a specialty in the analysis of fMRI data.  I am currently working as a Research Scientist in the lab of [Russ Poldrack](https://poldracklab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.  You can check out my [CV](/assets/files/mumford_cv.pdf) for the nitty gritty.

# Learning resources

Get your learn on.  The MumfordBrainStats [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/mumfordbrainstats) and [Tumblr](http://mumfordbrainstats.tumblr.com/) covers a wide range of topics related to the analysis of fMRI data as well as some non-Neuroimaging tutorials.  Here are a few examples of topic covered.

- **Learning Mixed Models?** The MumfordBrainStats [Mixed Models Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2iAtgpI4YEAUiEQ1ZnfMXY-yewNzn9z) was designed to help users of lmer() in R gain more intuition about their models and includes a companion [bookdown with code and examples](https://jmumford.github.io/MixedModelSeries/index.html)


- **Just getting started with fMRI?** Check out my [End of Summer Cram Session](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2iAtgpI4YHkZcDGfuKuAlQLSHx7pqLo).

- **What makes an fMRI experiment efficient?** This series on [efficiency of fMRI designs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2iAtgpI4YEnBdb_jDGmMcdGoIBwhCCY) explains the concept and supplies code so you can design your own efficient study.

- **Collinearity...what is it?  Is it bad?  Should I orthogonalize?**. The answer to the last question is a firm **NO**, but this [series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2iAtgpI4YGoXjV-Ar_xuRIxvND9Q3WJ) answers all of these questions and more.
