# What happened to the fmripower tool?

The fMRIPower tool hit old age and was starting to have quite a few issues.  I have chosen to replace the tool with a set of instructions so you can carry out power analyses on your own.  I will post that information soon!  In a nutshell, all you really need to do is perform an ROI analysis, get your effect size and carry out a power analyis using that effect size.  Of course, don't forget, you must use an a priori ROI.  I realize it is super frustrating, but you cannot use the ROI that was active in the same data set from which you are running the power analysis.

Hopefully that's enough for now, but I will make a video and blog post with instructions soon.
